# Intro Notes
- Kalman Filters address sensor noise: inaccurate readings due to unfriendy environments to data collection or interferences with the sensor (wind, unexpected events, obstacles, etc.)
- Bayesian probability determines what is likely to be true based on past information

## Jupiter
- First, you must always run the topmost code cell, the one with the comment **#format the book**. It is directly above. This does not just set up formatting, which you might not care about, but it also loads some necessary modules and makes some global settings regarding plotting and printing. So, always run this cell unless you are just passively reading.
- The line **%matplotlib** inline causes plots to be displayed inside the notebook. 
- Running the code inside a cell is easy. Click on it so that it has focus (a box will be drawn around it), and then press CTRL-Enter.
- If you haven't run anything yet just choose Run All Above from the Cell menu item. That's the easiest way to ensure everything has been run.
